"""
Merge the two board-results parsers into the single denormalized fact
(clean/board_results.parquet → BQ board_results_fact_passes).

One grain, with the sentinel "All Categories" / "All Streams" for cells a cut
doesn't break out (the values AISHE/MoE already use):

  Class X overall   (Table 3/1, Sec A)  → level="Class X",  social_category="All Categories", stream="All Streams"
  Class XII overall (Table 3/1, Sec B)  → level="Class XII", social_category="All Categories", stream="All Streams"
  Class XII stream  (Tables 13/15/17 or 31/33/35) → level="Class XII", social_category, stream  (passed only)

Grain: (year, level, state, board, social_category, stream, gender) → passed
Extra measures registered / appeared / pass_percentage are populated only on the
overall (All-Categories, All-Streams) rows; NULL on the stream/category
breakdowns (the source only publishes pass counts there).

The Class XII (All Categories, All Streams) total comes from the overall table
(richer measures); the duplicate row from the stream table is dropped.

Usage:
